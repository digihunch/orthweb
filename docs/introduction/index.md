## Overview

Orthanc handles sensitive data and must be hosted on secure platforms. The motive of **Orthweb** project is to accelerate Orthanc deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The Orthweb project includes:

1. A prescriptive architecture optimized for hosting Orthanc. The architecture is opinionated but suitable for common scenarios. The architecture design is discussed in the [Infrastructure](../design/infrastructure.md) section.

2. The implementation artifact for the prescriptive architecture using[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to manage infrastructure as code. The **Orthanc Terraform template** is available in the [orthweb](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb) GitHub repository.

3. A baseline Orthanc configuration with key plugins such as advanced authorization and auxiliary services such as KeyCloak. The artifact for configuration management is available in the [orthanc-config](https://github.com/digihunchinc/orthanc-config) GitHub repository. To customize configuration, create a fork of this repo.

While **Orthweb** provisions a fully functional Orthanc solution, there are some areas it does not intend to address. One example is ingress traffic management, whose design must account for integration with the current infrastructure and security setup, which is vastly different from organziation to organization.

## Use case

If you have an AWS account without networking foundation for Orthanc, the template in [Orthweb](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb) suits exactly to your needs. Then you may use the automation artifact in [orthanc-config](https://github.com/digihunchinc/orthanc-config), or your own repository, to configure Orthanc. 

If you have pre-created networking layer (e.g. VPC, subnets), then you only need to create virtual machine with relevant dependencies before installing Orthanc. You can use **Orthweb** as a reference implementation to examine how the application interact with underlying cloud resources, and potentially reuse some Terraform [modules](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb/tree/main/terraform/modules) in the repo. 

To allow Terraform to create resources in AWS, it needs sufficient permissions for deployment. Such permission for deployment usually requires administrator-level access.

## Choice of Tools

Orthweb is based on numerous open-source tools and commercial cloud services. Here are the rationales behind the choice:

**Terraform** is a widely used infrastructure-as-code utility. The templates are written in Hashicorp Configuration Language(HCL), which strikes a good balance between declarativeness and level of abstraction. However, you do need to securely store [Terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state), and be wary of its [workflow nuances](https://itnext.io/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e). 

**Docker** is a simple way to host container workload. The **Orthweb** solution uses `Docker Compose` to orchestrate several containers of different purposes which is widely used by application developers. [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is an alternative with some [limitations](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb/issues/1#issuecomment-852669561) and concerns on platform lock-in.

**PostgreSQL** is the choice of database amongst all the database engines that Orthanc supports. It is feature rich and supports analytical workloads. AWS has two flavours of managed PostgreSQL: `RDS for PostgreSQL` and `Aurora PostgreSQL`. The Orthweb solutions works with the former. 

**Nginx Proxy** is a widely adopted reverse proxy to handle incoming requests. There are several alternative reverse proxy technologies. From 2022 to 2024, **Orthweb** uses Envoy Proxy. Since 2024, Orthweb switched back to Nginx as the default reverse proxy because it is the popular choice in the Orthanc user community.

**Amazon S3** is a scalable, feature-rich object storage platform well integrated with other AWS cloud services. S3 is the de-facto standard for object storage and Orthanc can store DICOM objects using S3 plugin. The pre-compiled binary for S3 plugin has been included the Orthanc release since 2022.


## Getting Started

If you just want to start deploying Orthanc, skip right to the [Deployment](../deployment/preparation.md) section. Otherwise, in the next section, we will discuss the architecture design, how to use and what to expect from the **Orthweb** solution.
