## Disclaimer

Despite the small infrastructure footprint, the maintainer for **Orthweb** project strives to ensure that the configuration is aligned with common compliance frameworks, such as:

 - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
 - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and ISO 27002

However, it is important to understand that the regulatory auditing is the responsibility of the project adopter. AWS Config and Security Hub are very helpful services for compliance review. You may directly contact [Digi Hunch](mailto:digihunch@gmail.com) for security issues.
